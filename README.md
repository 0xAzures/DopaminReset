### Dopamin Reset

A simple daily protocol to reduce overstimulation and rebuild boredom tolerance.
You do 15 minutes of doing nothing, then 15 minutes of paper reading.
For social media, you use a strict brake so opening becomes a conscious choice, not a reflex.
Over time, urges drop, focus returns, and long form reading and creative thinking feel natural again.
