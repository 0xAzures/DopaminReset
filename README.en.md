**Goal**  
Reduce overstimulation.  
Restore calm, focus, and creativity.  
Turn social media from reflex into choice.

## Daily core

Part 1: 15 minutes doing nothing  
Part 2: 15 minutes reading on paper  
Do Part 1 and Part 2 back to back.

### Part 1: 15 minutes doing nothing

Duration  
15 minutes every day, ideally at the same time.

Setup

1. Put your phone out of reach.
2. No music, no podcasts, no screens.
3. Sit, stand, or walk slowly.

Steps

1. Check the time and mentally commit to the next 15 minutes.
2. Do absolutely nothing for 15 minutes.
3. Let thoughts come and go.
4. Do not judge. Do not capture. Do not plan. Just notice whatever shows up, without evaluating it.
5. If restlessness appears, continue. Stay in the exercise.

Rules

1. No notes.
2. No planning.
3. No multitasking.
4. Let attention and perception wander.

### Part 2: 15 minutes reading on paper

Duration  
15 minutes, right after Part 1, ideally at a fixed time.

Setup

1. Paper book only. Long form text, not short content like news.
2. No phone.
3. No e reader.
4. No screen.

Steps

1. Check the time and mentally commit to the next 15 minutes.
2. Read calmly.
3. When the urge to check, verify, or capture something appears, notice it and keep reading.

Rule  
Daily short beats occasional long.

## Social media containment

Pick one system and stick to it for at least 30 days.

### Option A: oneSec app on your phone for social media reduction

App

1. oneSec, optionally Premium.

Link  
https://one-sec.app/

What the app does  
oneSec forces a short breathing exercise before an app like TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook becomes usable.  
Then you set a usage duration.

Steps each time you open

1. Do the breathing exercise.
2. Set the usage duration to X minutes, as short as possible.
3. When time is up, close the app via the oneSec button.
4. After closing, take a moment to appreciate that you actively broke the algorithm loop.

Rules

1. Do not extend automatically.
2. If you extend, do it consciously and rarely.

### Option B: fixed scroll count habit for social media (TikTok, Instagram, Facebook)

Rule  
Always the same number. No negotiation.

Choose a fixed number between 3 and 7.

Steps each time

1. One slow inhale. One slow exhale.
2. Open the social media app.
3. Scroll and count each scroll until you reach your fixed number.
4. When you reach the number, close the app immediately.
5. Pause for 3 seconds. Notice: I actively broke the algorithm loop.

If you break the rule

1. Close as soon as you notice.
2. Be strict again on the next open.
3. No drama. The habit needs time to form in your brain.

## Extra rules

### No phone rule in the bathroom

No phone in the bathroom.

### No phone rule in the bedroom

No phone in the bedroom.  
Charge the phone outside the bedroom.  
Better: use a separate analog alarm clock.

### Smartphone hotkey: switch to grayscale

Goal  
The screen becomes black and white, less attractive, fewer triggers.  
It also reduces eye strain, especially in the evening.

Set this up on your phone  
Press the right side button three times to toggle grayscale on or off.

## Notice the change and reward yourself

It works when

1. Your open rate for social media apps goes down.
2. You can read longer without the urge to check your phone.
3. Long form reading feels easier.
