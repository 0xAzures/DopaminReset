## Daily core routine

Do Part 1 then Part 2 back to back.

### Part 1 15 minutes doing nothing

Duration
15 minutes every day

Setup
Phone out of reach
No music, podcasts, or screens
Sit, stand, or walk slowly

Steps
1 Set a 15 minute timer
2 Do absolutely nothing
3 Let thoughts come and go
4 No judging, no fixing, no planning
5 When restlessness shows up, stay with it

Rules
No notes
No to do list
No multitasking

### Part 2 15 minutes paper reading

Duration
15 minutes every day, right after Part 1

Setup
Paper book only
No phone, no e reader

Steps
1 Set a 15 minute timer
2 Read calmly
3 When the urge to check appears, notice it and keep reading

Rule
Daily short beats occasional long

## Social media containment

Pick one system and stick to it for at least 30 days.

### Option A blocker plus time cap

Goal
Interrupt autopilot
Make opening intentional

Steps each time you open
1 Complete the short breathing prompt
2 Set a usage limit of 5 minutes
3 When time is up, close the app

Rule
Do not extend by default
If you extend, do it consciously and rarely

### Option B fixed scroll count habit

Goal
Replace autopilot with a strict micro habit
Short use without slipping in
Feel control fast

Rule
Always the same number
No negotiation

Choose one number
3 or 7

Steps each time
1 Open the app
2 One slow inhale and one slow exhale
3 Scroll and count 1, 2, 3 up to your number
4 When you hit the number, close the app immediately
5 Pause for 3 seconds
6 Notice: I decided

If you break the rule
Close immediately
No catching up
Next open is strict again

## Weekly check

Track once per week
1 How many opens per day for social media
2 How many minutes you can read on paper without the urge to grab your phone

If opens go down and reading gets easier, it works.
